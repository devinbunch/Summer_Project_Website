# Multi-Genre Project 
### Summer Splinter

Your mission is to create a webpage with either Google Sites or Adobe Spark (or another website creation service) that encourages your audience to care about a cause that you care about. Your website should ask the question “What would make you care about _______?”, and then should make an argument about why you should care.

The requirements:
> Your website must be accessible on the web by anyone who sends a link
All research must be cited properly ON YOUR WEBSITE (consider including a Works Cited portion of your website)
You must include three genres of work (for example: text, graph, pictures, music, videos, etc.)
The title of your website should be “What would make you care about ________?”
Include one section on what others can do to help

What  would make you care about Human Sex Trafficking? If it was someone you knew? If it was your own daughter.
